<!-- 
In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

   Objects are objects
   Maths are objects
   Functions are objects
   Dates are objects
   Arrays are objects
   Maps are objects
   Sets are objects
All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.

A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods.
JavaScript defines 7 types of primitive data types:

   1.string
   2.number
   3.boolean
   4.null
   5.undefined
   6.symbol
   7.bigint 
           "Hello" is always "Hello".
           if x = 3.14, you can change the value of x, but you cannot change the value of 3.14.
           Here 3.14 is Primitive
           (true/false/null/undefined) is always (true/false/null/undefined)
-->
